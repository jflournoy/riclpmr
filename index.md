# riclpmr: A package for creating RI-CLPM syntax for lavaan

This riclpmr package is a set of tools for creating lavaan-style model
specifications of Random Intercept Cross Lag Panel Models for arbitrarily
large numbers of constructs and measurement occations.

It also contains a helpful function for passing this model specification to the appropriate `lavaan` or `blavaan` function.

See [this blog post](https://jflournoy.github.io/2017/10/20/riclpm-lavaan-demo/) for more information about the model.

To install:

```
devtools::install_github('jflournoy/riclpmr')
```
