# riclpmr

This is an R package that should help you generate `lavaan` syntax for random intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPMs) for multivariate longitudinal designs. It is very much in alpha, so please check the output carefully and raise any issues. 

For documentation, such as it is, see [here](https://jflournoy.github.io/riclpmr/). The main function is [`riclpm_text`](https://jflournoy.github.io/riclpmr/reference/riclpm_text.html).

See [this tutorial](https://jflournoy.github.io/2017/10/20/riclpm-lavaan-demo/) for more information about the models.
